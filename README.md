Text Analysis of Twitter data

A fun project that I did during the weekend. The purpose of this project is to take out the sentiments from the twitter texts. 
Here is a summary of the following project:

Example Workflow:

1. Data Cleaning:

Input: "@user #white #supremacists want everyone to see the new â #birdsâ #movie â and hereâ s why" 
Step 1: "user white supremacists want everyone to see the new â birdsâ movie â and here's why" 
Step 2: "white supremacist want everyone see birdsâ movie hereâs"

2. Sentiment Analysis:

Input: "user white supremacists want everyone to see the new â birdsâ movie â and here's why" 
Output: "partially negative"
